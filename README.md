## Usage

To use the provided functions, first ensure you have a CSV file with your data. The CSV file should have the following columns: `title`, `artist`, `album`, `genre`, and `year`.

Place your CSV file in the same directory as the script and update the file name in the script if necessary.

### Example Usage

```python
from process_song import get_dict_list, top_five_year, top_five_artist, top_five_decade, top_five_album

# Load the data
d_list = get_dict_list("Top500Songs.csv")

# Get the top five years based on the number of songs
print(top_five_year(d_list))

# Get the top five artists based on the number of songs
print(top_five_artist(d_list))

# Get the top five decades based on the number of songs
print(top_five_decade(d_list))

# Get the top five albums based on the number of songs
print(top_five_album(d_list))
```

## Functions

### `get_dict_list(filename)`

- **Parameters**: `filename` (str): The name of the CSV file.
- **Returns**: `list`: A list of dictionaries.

### `top_five_year(d_list)`

Returns a list of tuples for the top five years based on the number of songs from that year.

### `top_five_artist(d_list)`

Returns a list of tuples for the top five artists based on the number of songs in the list.

- **Parameters**: `d_list` (list): The list of dictionaries representing the dataset.
- **Returns**: `list`: A list of tuples.

### `top_five_decade(d_list)`

Returns a list of tuples for the top five decades (40, 50, 60, etc) based on the number of songs from that decade.

- **Parameters**: `d_list` (list): The list of dictionaries representing the dataset.
- **Returns**: `list`: A list of tuples.

### `top_five_album(d_list)`

Returns a list of tuples for the top five albums based on the number of songs from that album.

- **Parameters**: `d_list` (list): The list of dictionaries representing the dataset.
- **Returns**: `list`: A list of tuples.
